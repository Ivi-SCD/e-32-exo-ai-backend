# Exo.AI - Detect Your Exoplanet Anywhere for Anyone

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning system for detecting exoplanets using data from NASA's K2, Kepler, and TESS space missions. The system processes raw astronomical data, performs advanced feature engineering, and trains ensemble models, classifiers optimized for high recall in exoplanet detection. Therefore in Exo.AI we went beyond ML Technology and implements all engineering process to develop an complete solution both for users and scientist, the users can visualize, learn and test exoplanet detections, scientist can view advanced metrics, train new models and manipulate our system with his our creativity.
